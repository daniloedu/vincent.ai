AI project to support elderly people welfare

<b>Origin</b>
Given that technology is not designed for Elderly people it's impossible for them to access basic services and even they're exposed to dangers when they utilize technology.

VICENT AI wants to solve that problem by using Amazon Echo in order to support Elderly to:
      -   Make purchases.
      -   Payments of utilities.
      -   Contact Family.
      -   Track their health (take correct medicine, vital signs, conversational).
      -   Emergency.
      -   It should be compatible with iOS, Android, SmarTVs, TVO, etc.
